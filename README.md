laser-bed
=========

A Venetian blind based cutting bed for laser cutters.

# Usage

Edit *configuration.scad* to suit your environment.

If you want the clamps on the end so you can join several lengths together, set add_joints and add_clamps to true. since these are so short you will probably want this. The reason they are so short is so I can cut them in my cutter. You can change the length in the configuration file if you have a different cutting area.

If you just want a few extra clamp parts, you can prints just *clamps.scad*

# ToDo

- [ ] Add mounting hardware and holes
- [ ] Add laser-cuttable focusing elevators
